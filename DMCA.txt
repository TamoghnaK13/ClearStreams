All the video content found on the ClearStreams is not hosted on our servers or is created or uploaded by us. ClearStreams simply acts as a search engine that finds videos from websites like YouTube, DailyMotion, Metacafe, Playwire and other video portals. ClearStreams is not responsible for external websiteâ€™s content. If you find that some of the content violates your rights you may request for that content to be brought down at the host that is responsible for the content. That will ensure that the content is removed from ClearStreams and other search engines that may have indexed the content.
